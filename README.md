## What I Hope to Accomplish
This app will be a copy cat of the [Spotify desktop app](https://open.spotify.com/collection/playlists). At this point I have decided to use the [styled-components library](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling, and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. I am most familiar with creating and using class component based React projects, so for this project I hope to make it purely functional component based as well as using the new [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)'s feature.

I hope to focus on organization - writing thorough and thoughtful PR's where writing out the process, will help me continue to learn even when I think I may already know something. Hopefully, I will be able to learn something new with every PR I put up. I would like to hold myself to high standards for organization of thought, and code - writing neat, readable code with well articulated comments when needed. Code that does well balancing effectiveness, and maintainability.








This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
